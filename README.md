UHSDR means <b>U</b>niversal<b>H</b>am<b>SDR</b> and consists of a firmware and bootloader part. It currently supports STM32F4 and STM32F7 MCU. The 
base of the firmware was started by Chris, M0NKA, and Clint, KA7OEI and was exclusively used for mcHF QRP transceiver designed by Chris. 
Since firmware is licensed under GPLv3 it is possible to adapt it to other homebrew rigs or other hardware platforms. Software development
is intended to give full support for mcHF (and all other known and listed hardware platforms).<br><br>
So this is the best place to start with up-2-date developed firmware and bootloader for mcHF. If you do want to start looking into the code 
we recommend to use this actual code - not completely outdated code which exists outside GitHub! If you use old firmware you will miss many, 
many new features of mcHF, the code contains much bugs and works very slowly. Structure of code is not a good starting point for beginners.<br>

If you only want binaries, you can find them for stable releases and pre-releases in "github releases".<br>

Binaries of actual development are available as "daily snapshots". Versioning is only done in RELEASES. For identifying daily snapshots you 
must use build time stamp which is shown in splash screen.<br>

All this is bundled in <a href="http://df8oe.github.io/mchf-github/">startup page</a>.<br>

Have fun - Open-Source opens possibilities!<br><br>
