Stable branch of mcHF firmware and bootloader - sources and binaries.

Binaries are located in mchf-eclipse and are named:
- bootloader.dfu
- mchf_binary_for_flash.bin

If you only want binaries and not complete sources klick on file you want to download and then  on the button "Raw" right above the grey bar.

Have fun - Open-Source opens possibilities!
