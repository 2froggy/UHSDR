This branch might have new features or possible bug-fixes - but it is in BETA STAGE. It might crash or not be usable in some functions. Testing for your own risk :) Binary for firmware-flashing in root directory.

Since 09/30/2015 this package contains a bootloader which allows firmware-updates via USB-key instead of connection to PC and using of mchf-manager. It is located in mchf-eclipse/bootloader. You can find there a .dfu - file for flashing. Bootloader is compatible with all existing firmware versions (of course versions released by KA7OEI Clint, too).

Have fun - Open-Source opens possibilities!

DF8OE, Andreas
