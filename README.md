<H3>This is the GitHub Repo related to firmware and bootloader for SDR-QRP-transceiver mcHF.</H3>

Explanation of different branches:

<b>master</b>: latest STABLE version
<b>testing</b>: latest upcoming version in testing stage, containing changes from actual work of every developer
<b>devel-ABCDEF-0.0.xxx.yyy.z</b>: devel version of specific developer.

Master and testing include binaries to use for end-users. It is recommended only to use these two branches as end-user!

All other branches may or may not.include binaries. Use is "for your own risk". Code maybe non-functional or instable.

If you want to take part in development use testing-branch as base for creatin your own branch named as "devels" above. Testing branch is the most up-to-date branch containing pre-release versions of their work.
