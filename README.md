This branch might have new features or possible bug-fixes - but it is in BETA STAGE. It might crash or not be usable in some functions. Testing for your own risk :) Binary for firmware-flashing in root directory.

Since 09/30/2015 this package contains a bootloader which allows firmware-updates via USB-key instead of connection to PC and using of mchf-manager. Bootloader is compatible with all existing firmware versions (of course versions released by KA7OEI Clint, too).

Binaries are located in mchf-eclipse and are named:
- bootloader.dfu
- mchf_binary_for_flash.bin
 
If you only want binaries and not complete sources click on file you want to download and then on the button "Raw" right above the grey bar.


Have fun - Open-Source opens possibilities!

DF8OE, Andreas
