Stable branch of mcHF firmware and bootloader - sources and binaries.

Binaries are located in mchf-eclipse and are named:

bootloader.dfu
mchf_binary_for_flash.bin
If you only want binaries and not complete sources click on file you want to download and then on the button "Raw" right above the grey bar.

Have fun - Open-Source opens possibilities!
