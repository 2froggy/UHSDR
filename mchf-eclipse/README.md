Devel branch of mcHF firmware and bootloader - sources


Version <219.27.x>

DEVEL branch does not contain binaries. DEVEL version may be instable,
functions are not working as inspected and you may loose settings.

So DEVEL is nothing to play around for beginners. You can build
binaries and test them AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Have fun - Open-Source opens possibilities!
