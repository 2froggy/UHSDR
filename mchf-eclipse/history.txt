- start: I used mcHF Firmware Source 219.19 from Clint KA7OEI as base of new mchf-firmware-community working with GITHUB

08/19/2015 (DF8OE)
- added detection of SI570 hardware address (possible addresses 0x50 / 0x55)
- added workaround for malfunction of startupfrequency detection during unattended boots or bootloops
- merging Eclipse and CooCox configuration to one package so that both IDEs can be used

09/07/2015 (DF8OE)
- created makefile (thanks to DL4SAI)
- commented out of some curious lines which prevent building using makefile
- building is now possible with makefile but there is one issue to find:
  firmware binary is 600 bytes shorter than binary generated by eclipse and does only show splashscreen, then ends

09/08/2015 (DF8OE)
- makefile is now working

09/09/2015 (DF8OE)
- I merged Clint KA7OEI new released version 219.22. This new version now is named 219.23 and will be the base
  for all future firmware developments - I hope...

09/15/2015 (DF8OE)
- added autodetection of HY28A / HY28B in SPI mode (hardware changing needed --> see wiki on github pages

09/30/2015 (DF8OE)
- creation aof new bootloader which allows firmware updates via USB-key

10/02/2015 (DF8OE)
- minor bugfixes in bootloader

10/10/2015 (KA7OEI)
- added "Load EEPROM default": Press-and-hold F1+F3+F5 on power-up, read and follow in-screen instructions
- bugfix "bandwidth indicator sometimes wrong when band was changed"

10/11/2015: Release of Version 219.24

10/28/2015 Version 0.0.219.26  [KA7OEI]
- Added "Load Defaults" obtained by holding F1, F3 AND F5 on power-up.  Once unit has
powered up, the user would DISCONNECT power to preserve the OLD settings or PRESS-AND-HOLD the
POWER button to save the new (default) settings to EEPROM and power down.  The unit halts on this
screen indefinitely.  Some defaults changes to be more useful.
- Added "button test" function where pressing-holding any button (other than power) during power-up will
display the button being being pressed (or the one with highest precedence if multiple) and the number
of buttons being pressed.
- Problem in which "PREV" and "NEXT" buttons on menu could skip last screen of "Configuration"
menu has been fixed.
- Fixed problem in which line under screen that indicates bandwidth/settings did not change under some
conditions (e.g. switching from one band to another where the same filter/settings were used, but
a different sideband was used).  Added "unconditional" update of this line when changing bands.
- Added "INVGray" and "Blue" waterfall palettes.
- Streamlined code related to DSP NR and Notch.
- Added keyboard beep.
- Completely rewrote AM demodulation to reduce CPU loading.
- Fixed problem (from 0.0.219.24) in which there were dead spots in Si570 tuning (incorrect FDCO Min/
max values).
- Added function where pressing-holding G3 will generate sidetone equivalent to CW offset, used for
"Spotting", in CW/LSB/USB modes/
- Added FM modulation/demodulation with squelch, subaudible tone encode/decode and tone burst.

- The following files have been added (I hope that I have them all here!):

  FILTERS:  iir_15k_hpf_fm_squelch.h   - Filter for squelch noise detection
            iir_2k7_tx_bpf_fm.h        - Filter for FM transmit audio

  AUDIO:    fm_dds_table.h             - DDS/NCO lookup table for FM/Subtone/Burst generation
            fm_subaudible_tone_table.h - List of subaudible tones for encode/decode
