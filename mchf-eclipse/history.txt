I used mcHF Firmware Source 219.19 from Clint KA7OEI as base.

Changes:

08/19/2015
- added detection of SI570 hardware address (possible addresses 0x50 / 0x55)
- added workaround for malfunction of startupfrequency detection during unattended boots or bootloops
- merging Eclipse and CooCox configuration to one package so that both IDEs can be used
