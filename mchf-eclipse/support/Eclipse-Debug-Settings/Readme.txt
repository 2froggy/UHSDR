Using the recent GNU ARM Eclipse v2.11 
(https://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/) 
and following the installation instructions to the letter
including the Packs Download (takes a while).
And then creating a debug configuration by making the 
entries marked with red boxes in a new Debug Configuration, 
you should be able to debug live with an ST-LINK V2 in 
no time at  all.
