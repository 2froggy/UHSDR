DF8OEs USB-Key-Bootloader For MCHF LED Codes
=========================================================

If bootloader is running backlight is on showing blank screen.
As long as backing up firmware to USB-key lasts green LED is
constantly on and backlight also. If backlight goes dark and
green LED stays lit backup-process finished successfully.

In programming process red LED is constantly on and backlight
also. If backlight goes dark and red LED stays lit programming-
process finished successfully.

In case of error LCD backlight blinks in an infinite loop.
Red and green LED helps to identify kind of error:


- all LEDs off:
see additional error codes

- red LED constantly on:
available flash in STM32F4 is too small for firmware

- red and green LED blinking too:
STM32F4 flash erase error

- red and green LED blinking against to backlight:
STM32F4 flash programming error

- red LED blinking against to backlight:
mchf.bin not found on USB-key

- green LED constantly on:
no space for backup firmware on USB-key

- green LED blinking against to backlight:
flash memory is write protected

Additional error codes are supported now using only backlight
flashes (and no other LED is on / blinking). Backlight flashes
several times short in infinite loop. The number of flashes
identifies error:

1 - unrecovered error
2 - no attached device detected
3 - device runs unsupported speed
4 - device not supported
5 - no FAT filesystem found


You can switch off mchf if in error state by pushing power
button.
